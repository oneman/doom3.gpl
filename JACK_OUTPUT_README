Jack Output for Doom3 
---------------------

Howdy. Here is Jack Output for Doom3. Its basically Alpha/First version that compiled and worked.


Notes: 

To enable jack output use: scons JACK=1

Then have your sound driver setting to "best" and it will try jack first. It will not start a server if one is not
running. The server needs to be running at 44100 sample rate. At this moment only stereo is supported but 6 channel
will be trivial to add later. 

On 64bit, you need to ensure your jack server is compiled with mixed mode 32/64bit support.
Additionally ensure with ldd that your doom3 binary is linking to the correct libjack.so that is mixed 32/64bit.


Do Enjoy!
